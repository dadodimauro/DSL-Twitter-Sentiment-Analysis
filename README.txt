In this folder you will find 4 Jupyter Notebook files:

1) "data_preprocessing.ipynb" where we did all the preprocessing, it outputs a file "clean_df.csv" used
   by the others notebooks.

2) "classification_random_forest.ipynb" where we tried a first approach to solve the problem, as 
   explained in the report. It doesn't output anything because the file used the reach the score in the
   leaderboard is the next one

3) "classification_linear_models" this is the file that outputs the results: "output_lr.csv", and 
   "output_svc.csv". We submitted both files in the site and the first one gave us the actual result
   N.B.
   This file was also used to create different .csv file later used to plot some graphs.

4) "data_visualization.csv" where, using all the output files from the previous notebooks, we created
   all the graphs used in the report. It outputs the graphs as pdf files.
